<h4>What are the symptoms?</h4>
<p>The word dementia describes a group of symptoms that may include memory loss, difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language, and sometimes changes in mood or behaviour. These changes are often small to start with, but for someone with dementia they have become bad enough to affect daily life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dementia isn&#8217;t a natural part of ageing. It occurs when the brain is affected by a disease.</p>
<p>There are many known causes of dementia &#8211; probably more than 100. The most common types are <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2227&amp;pageNumber=5">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a> and <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2227&amp;pageNumber=5">vascular</a>. Some people have a combination of these, known as <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2227&amp;pageNumber=5">mixed dementia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is predicted there will be around 850,000 people in the UK with the disease in 2018.</li>
<li>The chance of developing  the disease increases significantly with age. One in 14 people over 65 years of age, and one in six people over 80, have it. It is more common among women than men.</li>
<li>More than 40,000 <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents.php?categoryID=200350">younger people</a> (under the age of 65) in the UK have the disease. This is called early-onset or young-onset dementia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dementia is an umbrella term. It describes the symptoms that occur when the brain is affected by certain diseases or conditions. There are many different types, although some are far more common than others. They are often named according to the condition that has caused the disease. Some of the more common types are outlined below.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the most common cause. During the course of the disease, the chemistry and structure of the brain changes, leading to the death of brain cells.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=100">What is Alzheimer&#8217;s disease?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Vascular dementia</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the oxygen supply to the brain fails, brain cells may die. The symptoms of vascular dementia can occur either suddenly, following a stroke, or over time, through a series of small strokes.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=161">What is vascular dementia?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dementia with Lewy bodies</h3>
<ul>
<li>This form of the disease gets its name from tiny spherical structures that develop inside nerve cells. Their presence in the brain leads to the degeneration of brain tissue.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=113">What is dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Fronto-temporal dementia</h3>
<ul>
<li>In fronto-temporal dementia, damage is usually focused in the front part of the brain. Personality and behaviour are initially more affected than memory.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=167">What is fronto-temporal dementia (including Pick&#8217;s disease)?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Rarer causes of dementia</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are many other rarer causes, including progressive supranuclear palsy and Binswanger&#8217;s disease. People with multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and Huntington&#8217;s disease can also be at an increased risk of developing the disease.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=135">Rarer causes of dementia</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prions are infectious agents that attack the central nervous system and then invade the brain, causing dementia. The best-known prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=135">Rarer causes of dementia</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Korsakoff&#8217;s syndrome</h3>
<ul>
<li>Korsakoff&#8217;s syndrome is a brain disorder that is usually associated with heavy drinking over a long period. Although it is not strictly speaking a type of the disease, people with the condition experience loss of short term memory.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=98">What is Korsakoff&#8217;s syndrome?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>HIV-related cognitive impairment</h3>
<ul>
<li>People with HIV and AIDS sometimes develop cognitive impairment, particularly in the later stages of their illness.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=97">What is HIV-related cognitive impairment?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Mild cognitive impairment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a relatively recent term, used to describe people who have some problems with their memory but do not actually have  the disease.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some carers may be required to care for a service user who relies on a ventilator (ventilator dependency) in order to breathe following a procedure known as a “trachestomy”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As medical technology and intervention evolves, more patients are faced with temporary and long-term tracheotomy/ventilation as a part of recovery. A tracheotomy is where an incision is made to a person’s windpipe in order to help them breathe. A tracheotomy is usually done for one of three reasons: to bypass an obstructed upper airway; to clean and remove secretions from the airway; to more easily, and usually more safely, deliver oxygen to the lungs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Conditions that can lead to respiratory failure and the need for a tracheostomy include:</h5>
<ul>
<li>being unconscious or in a coma as a result of a severe head injury or stroke</li>
<li>paralysis (an inability to move one or more muscles) after a serious spinal cord injury</li>
<li>a condition that damages the lungs, such as pneumonia or cystic fibrosis</li>
<li>a condition that damages the nervous system, such as motor neurone disease or Guillain-Barré syndrome</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a service user has a trachestomy tube, a carer will be required to understand the basic functionality of the device and may be required to assist service users to manage the tube, especially during swallowing and oral communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the respiratory therapist sets up the ventilator and usually makes major changes as per the doctor’s orders, there are basic principles that apply to all ventilators that every carer should be familiar with when working with any ventilator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Required skills for carers who look after ventilator dependant service users include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>understanding the illness which causes the patient to require a ventilator;</li>
<li>interpretation of the basic principles of blood gases in relation to ventilator settings;</li>
<li>knowing and demonstrating the appropriate times to notify a doctor in regards to the status of a patient;</li>
<li>knowing the signs, symptoms and treatment of a pneumothorax;</li>
<li>demonstrating how to check breath sounds and observe for dislocation of the tracheostomy tube;</li>
<li>demonstrating how to change a tracheostomy tube;</li>
<li>demonstrating how to use an ambu bag;</li>
<li>demonstrating proper suctioning techniques;</li>
<li>knowing the reasons for weaning appropriately and how to wean, as well as the need for increasing ventilator settings;</li>
<li>being familiar with the ventilator, its tubings, heater and various alarms;</li>
<li>being familiar with the humidification systems;</li>
<li>demonstrating how to troubleshoot some ventilator problems;</li>
<li>demonstrating basic care such as bathing, turning, positioning, ambulation and current procedural terminology when the patient is on a ventilator; and</li>
<li>knowing and demonstrating basic life support for healthcare providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding the proper functioning and the adverse effects that can occur to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems (such as respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and pulmonary hypertension), are just a few examples of the knowledge nurses should have.</p>
<p>It also is important to be aware of potential complications of mechanical ventilation. In short these include, but are not limited to; the development of acidosis, blocked airways, bronchospasm, infections, damage to tracheal tissues and oxygen toxicity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>Ventilator Weaning</u></h3>
<p>There are several ways in which patients can be weaned off a ventilator. To begin the process, a patient might go from the assist-control setting to a synchronized intermittent mandatory- ventilation setting. The breathing effort can be more negative to exercise the respiratory muscles and the diaphragm to generate negative pressure in the chest and lungs to draw fresh air into the lungs. The breath rate can also be gradually decreased and PEEP can be gradually reduced to zero. A trial of CPAP might also be given. Some doctors will also order increasing times off the ventilator once the settings are low, such as 5 minutes off the ventilator, 5 minutes on, and gradually increase the time off as tolerated by the patient.</p>
<p>The goal in caring for patients at home is to assist them in participating in the most normal life as possible and fulfilling their goals for the best quality of life they can attain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where an individual requires care, and is able to give their consent, it may be advisable for a member, or members of their family to be granted a power of attorney. This gives them the power to act legally on their relative’s behalf for financial and property matters, plus decisions on welfare and medical treatment. Although not mandatory, it is advisable to establish a lasting power of attorney through a solicitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>What is a power of attorney?</u></h3>
<p>A power of attorney enables someone else to manage your affairs on your behalf when you are no longer able to or no longer want to.</p>
<h4>The variety of Power of Attorney include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Property and Financial Affairs Power of Attorney</li>
<li>Heath &amp; Welfare Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)</li>
<li>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)</li>
<li>Ordinary Power of Attorney (OPA)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An LPA is a legal document which allows you to choose someone to make decisions for you when you no longer want to or are no longer able to. LPA replaced the previous system of Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) in 2007, and gives your representative the right to manage your affairs and make decisions on your behalf. There are two types of LPA – one for Property and Financial Affairs and for Health and Welfare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Property and Financial Affairs Power of Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>A Property and Financial Affairs LPA enables you to give an attorney the power to make any decisions as if they were you (acting in your best interests of course).</p>
<p>The LPA needs to be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) in England and Wales before the person can act on your behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Health and Welfare Lasting Power or Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>A Health and Welfare LPA enables someone of your choice to make decision about some or all of your health and welfare matters. Your appointed attorney(s) will only be able to make decisions after the LPA is registered with the OPG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Enduring Power of Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>Although LPA replaced Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) in 2007, EPAs that were made before 1 October 2007 can still be used. EPAs must be registered with the OPG (Office of the Public Guardian) if the donor is losing mental capacity. EPA only covers property and finances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Ordinary Power of Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>Another type of PoA is known as Ordinary Power of Attorney which only covers property and finances and ceases if the donor loses mental capacity. Ordinary PoA never needs to be registered with any authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>When to set up an Lasting Power of Attorney</u></h4>
<p>Anyone aged 18 or over can make an LPA appointing one or more attorneys to act on their behalf. It is important to make the LPA while you are still capable of making decisions about who to appoint as your attorneys and what powers you want to give them. The LPA cannot be used until it is registered with the OPG, which you can do at any point after it has been made. Even after it has been registered, your attorneys will have to act within any restrictions or conditions you have set out in the LPA form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>For more information on this subject, we recommend reading the Citizen&#8217;s Advice guide to POA, which can be found <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/family/looking-after-people/managing-affairs-for-someone-else/">here</a>.</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Replacement/respite is designed to give a break to unpaid carers. Breaks enable carers to have better physical and mental wellbeing and can enhance the relationship with the person they care for. Breaks also benefit the service user by providing them with new opportunities, social interactions and exposure to new things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What is respite care?</h4>
<p>Respite care comes in different forms. It may be wise to discuss with a professional (e.g. social worker) what the best option is for your situation. We are also happy to provide you with free information about what may be available in your area if you are unable to look this up yourselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>day centres</li>
<li>care at home</li>
<li>a short stay in a care home</li>
<li>Shared Lives</li>
<li>holidays or short breaks</li>
<li>carers&#8217; emergency replacement care schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When considering respite care, it&#8217;s important to think about the type of care the service user needs. Full-time nursing care is expensive and may not always be necessary. When arranging care with a homecare agency or care home, a care plan should be written that meets the individual needs of the service user. Similarly, if the service user has a needs assessment, this should help identify their care needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Respite care for children and young people</strong></h6>
<p>Respite care allows disabled children and young people to participate in and enjoy a diverse range of activities and their families to have a rest from their routine caring responsibilities.</p>
<p>Violet Care Agency supports children and young people with various disabilities, including those with moving and handling needs, with very severe, complex and/or challenging needs who may or may not have medical or nursing needs, disabled children on the autistic spectrum with additional impairments and older disabled children.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>How is replacement care provided?</h4>
<p>It is the local authority&#8217;s responsibility to help carers take breaks. The service user and their carers have a needs assessment which helps social services to identify what a person&#8217;s care needs are. If the criteria is met, it can be discussed with the local authority about how you want the needs to be met. A needs/carer assessment is available to anyone in England who appears to have support needs and can be requested by themselves or a professional like a GP or hospital consultant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council"><strong><em><u>Contact your local authority here.</u></em></strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some service users and carers may want to arrange and pay for replacement care outside of any arrangements awarded by the local authority. If someone chooses to do this, it is their responsibility to find and arrange the replacement care either with an individual, a care agency or a care home.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Types of replacement care</h3>
<h4>Care at home</h4>
<p>Replacement care can be provided in the home of the service user. Many people may prefer this because they can stay in a familiar environment and maintain daily routines. Replacement care at home can involve a personal assistant, support worker or paid carer visiting the home. They may do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>come in during the day to give the carer a break, with the carer using the time to do something they want to do (eg go to the shops, visit friends or pursue education or a hobby)</li>
<li>spend time with the person and engage them in social activities both inside and outside of the home</li>
<li>come in to the home to care for the person during the night to give the carer a chance to sleep</li>
<li>stay with the person or make regular visits over a certain period of time so that the carer can go on holiday or have an extended break away from the home.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Replacement care at home can be arranged through the local authority, or privately, directly with a homecare agency. A carer from a homecare agency may be able to provide replacement care for a few hours a day, regular visits (eg three times a day) or 24-hour support for the person at home, depending on their needs. Some care agencies (like Violet Care) specialise in providing 24-hour live-in care. This is usually more expensive than a place in a care home. If the local authority is funding replacement care there may be a limit on what they will fund. If they can meet the person&#8217;s needs in a cheaper way, for example in a care home, then they will do so. However, these decisions cannot be based on cost alone and the local authority must discuss the arrangements with the person and their carer.</p>
<p>Another option is to employ a personal assistant to provide care. If the carer or service user is receiving a direct payment, they may want to use this to employ a personal assistant directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Friends and family</em></strong></p>
<p>If the service user wants to stay at home, family and friends may be able to spend some time with the person to give the main carer a break. Alternatively, family and friends could have the service user stay with them, if the carer wants to have a break at home.</p>
<p>The service user and their carer may be more comfortable with this arrangement because the person will be spending time with someone familiar. Relatives may also be more familiar with the person&#8217;s routine and preferences.</p>
<p>However, family members and friends may not be able or willing to take on this responsibility. It can help to talk to them and try to find solutions that work for everyone.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4>Care away from home</h4>
<p><strong><em>Day centres</em></strong></p>
<p>Day centres can provide a range of support for a service user, including activities and social interaction. It may take the service user a while to adjust to attending a day centre, and initially they may need support and encouragement to go. Some carers find accompanying the person for the first few visits helps. It&#8217;s important for staff at the day centre to get to know the person and treat them as an individual. This will mean they can help the person settle in and make sure that activities meet their needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Holidays and short breaks</em></strong></p>
<p>Replacement care can also take the form of a short break or a holiday. Some organisations provide specialist package holidays for service users and their carers. They include support with caring tasks, and facilities that are accessible and disability friendly. This means the carer can have a break from their caring role and focus on spending quality time with the person they care for. Taking a holiday together may require a lot of planning. It&#8217;s important that arrangements are made with the provider in advance, if possible, so that the service user and their carer both know what to expect. The service user may need extra support when coping with the new environment or changes to their routine.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Care homes</em></strong></p>
<p>The service user can stay in a care home for replacement care. There are different types of care home, providing different levels of care in addition to accommodation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some care homes provide assistance with personal care (eg washing and bathing). These are often referred to as residential care homes.</li>
<li>Some care homes provide nursing care as well as personal care. They provide care with a registered nurse on site 24 hours a day. These are often known as nursing homes.</li>
<li>Some care homes are registered as dementia care homes. These specialise in caring for and supporting service users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some care homes have beds set aside for people requiring replacement care. However, it can be difficult to get replacement care in a care home when it is wanted or needed because it depends on a room being available. If possible it can help to plan ahead for when replacement care will be needed.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Other options</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shared Lives</em></strong></p>
<p>Shared Lives is an alternative to homecare and care home arrangements. It is a national scheme where the service user can spend time in the home of another carer and give their own carer a break. Availability may depend on the local area. The local authority or local Shared Lives organisation can provide more information.</p>

<p>Some local authorities or carers&#8217; organisations will provide replacement care to the service user in an emergency (usually between 48 and 72 hours depending on the situation). The local authority or local carers&#8217; centre can provide more information and say what is available in a certain area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How is replacement care funded?</h4>
<p>Replacement care services can sometimes be provided free but are usually means-tested. The Care Act 2014 means that replacement care is now recognised as a service to the service user, who may have to pay, and that the carer should not be charged. However, if the service user has a needs assessment but is found not to have eligible support needs, the carer can be asked to pay for replacement care, subject to a financial assessment that the local authority will carry out.</p>
<h5><em>There are a range of options that may be appropriate when it comes to funding replacement care.</em></h5>
<p>Some replacement care services may be provided free of charge by the local authority. Many are means-tested, which means the service user may have to contribute towards the cost. The local authority will calculate the cost of the services to be provided and then financially assess the person, to see how much the person should contribute to the cost of these services.</p>
<p>If a service user is funding the replacement care themselves, they should contact the organisation providing the replacement care directly to ask about availability and to sort out the financial arrangements. It is important to gain a thorough understanding of what is included in any contract to provide care and support. This will help to avoid misunderstandings or unexpected costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Funding arrangements</h4>
<p><strong><em>Care homes</em></strong></p>
<p>The local authority can charge the service user for short-term stays in care homes (under eight weeks) in one of two ways. They can assess the amount they should pay based on their income and capital and according to national rules. Alternatively, they can charge what they think is a &#8216;reasonable&#8217; amount, although this should take account of individual circumstances and leave the person with enough money to run their household. There are national rules about how much the person should be left to live on. A financial assessment may be carried out to establish how much the person should pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Care in the community</em></strong></p>
<p>If care is provided in the person&#8217;s own home, the local authority can ask the service user to pay a &#8216;reasonable&#8217; amount toward the cost. As with temporary replacement stays in care homes, the person must be left with enough money to run their home and to live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Vouchers</em></strong></p>
<p>Instead of organising services directly, some local authorities may give people vouchers that can be used with local services. For more information contact the local authority or local carers centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Direct payments</em></strong></p>
<p>After a needs assessment, the amount of money identified as being necessary to meet the person&#8217;s needs is called a personal budget. A service user may decide to receive their personal budget allocation in the form of a direct payment. A direct payment is paid directly to the person, to pay for their care and support. They aim to give people greater flexibility and choice over how their needs are met. They can be used in a number of ways, such as employing a personal assistant, taking a break with a carer, or replacement care in a care home for up to four weeks in any 12-month period. However, the direct payment can only be spent as agreed in the person&#8217;s support plan and it will be agreed in advance how it will be used to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Carers may also be entitled to a direct payment depending on their need for support. Again, it must be used to meet the needs and achieve the goals identified in their support plan. A carer may hire a paid carer from an agency, for example to help with shopping trips, or they may use the direct payment to pay for a supported holiday or for education. The local authority can give information on personal budgets and eligibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><em>Other funding</em></strong></h5>
<p>A person may be able to get help with the cost of funding replacement care or taking a break from a charity, grant-making trust or benevolent fund. Ex-service organisations, as well as those that support retired people in a particular type of work, may also help. The local carers centre or Alzheimer&#8217;s Society can advise on what is available locally.</p>
<p>There may also be national organisations that can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Carer&#8217;s allowance</em></strong></p>
<p>For someone receiving Carer&#8217;s allowance, their entitlement continues for a period of up to 12 weeks inside a 26-week time span, or until Disability living allowance (DLA), Personal independence payment (PIP) or Attendance allowance entitlement for the person they care for, stops. Consequently, a short period of replacement care, within these limits, should not affect their entitlement to Carer&#8217;s allowance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Giving information to replacement care providers</h4>
<p>It is helpful for carers to give information to those providing replacement care. This can support them while they care for the service user. It may help to use a tool such as The Violet care all about me manual, which service users and their carers can use to tell staff about their needs, preferences, likes, dislikes and interests.</p>
<p>It will be helpful to write things down for the carers, including information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>what the service user likes and dislikes; this could range from food preferences to a favourite jumper</li>
<li>details of their routine: what time they get up, what time they like to eat, any activities they enjoy doing throughout the day</li>
<li>specific ways to support the person if they become upset or distressed</li>
<li>any medicines they need to take</li>
<li>any sensory or physical difficulties they may have</li>
<li>dietary, religious and cultural needs</li>
<li>any hobbies and interests the person has</li>
<li>if the person is being looked after at home, details about the running of the home, eg which key locks which door, how the washing machine works, which day the bins are collected</li>
<li>important phone numbers, eg the person&#8217;s GP</li>
<li>emergency contact details, eg the carer or another family member or friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Replacement care: tips for carers</h3>
<p>If you care for a service user and are thinking of arranging replacement care for them, there are some things it can help to do and think about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan ahead &#8211; New environments can be challenging for a service user. It can help to set up a regular replacement care routine, to help both you and the person adjust. Some people find it helpful to use replacement care in the early stages of a progressive condition, or before they feel it is needed, rather than at the later stages or if a crisis or emergency situation arises. This can give you a feel for replacement care, as well as a chance to try different types.</li>
<li>Consider short breaks or short visits to start with &#8211; This will mean you, the person and those providing replacement care can get to know each other. It may help to build confidence before a longer visit.</li>
<li><a href="/contact-us/">Arrange a needs assessment</a> &#8211; If both you and the person have an assessment of your needs, it will help you both to know what you need and the options you have.</li>
<li>Talk about replacement care &#8211; Some people find openly talking about replacement care helpful. It will give both you and the service user a chance to discuss your options and your feelings. You know the person best, so will know the best way to talk to them.</li>
<li>Talk to paid carers &#8211; It&#8217;s important for a paid carer to get to know the person and what works for them. Talking to them about their needs and their routine can help. For care at home, it can help for the person and the new carer to spend time together (possibly with you to start with) so they get to know each other and build a relationship before the replacement care starts.</li>
<li>Visit the care home or day centre &#8211; Ask carers about their training and experience, and what care and support they can provide. The quality of care the person will receive is important. You may feel more confident with the replacement care arrangement if you know what training and skills the staff have.</li>
<li>Talk to others &#8211; Talking to other carers about your feelings can help. They may be able to give tips and suggestions. However, it&#8217;s important to remember what works for one person may not work for another. You may also want to talk to a professional (eg support worker) about how you&#8217;re feeling.</li>
<li>Focus on the benefits &#8211; You may be worried that a replacement care arrangement won&#8217;t provide the same level of care as you can, or that the person will become unsettled. It is natural to be concerned, but try to focus on how the break will support you in your caring role.</li>
<li>Keep trying &#8211; Replacement care is an adjustment for everyone. If something doesn&#8217;t work or doesn&#8217;t go to plan, try not to give up. Another type of replacement care or another location may be more successful. You may need to try different options to find what works best for you and the person.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Adapting to replacement care</h4>
<p>When carers and service users access replacement care they may experience difficulties. The carer may also have some worries, for example about how the person is settling in, whether they are being well cared for, or if their routine is being disrupted.</p>
<p>The carer should find out if there are certain things worrying the person. If they know what they&#8217;re worried about they will be better able to support and reassure them. It may also mean carers can look at ways to address the worry. For example, if the person is concerned about being in an unfamiliar environment, the carer could ensure they take a few favourite items and some photographs with them. Following some of the tips mentioned earlier in this factsheet might help to address some concerns. Experiencing difficulties is not unusual, and it is normal for a carer to be nervous about the experience. However, these feelings shouldn&#8217;t discourage them from taking a break.</p>
<p>Caring for a service user is a complex and challenging job. There are positive and negative aspects, and each carer will cope with their situation in different ways.</p>
<p>Taking a break is not always an easy decision to make, and carers may feel worried or guilty. They may feel that replacement care will create more stress and that the quality of the care will not be up to their standards. It&#8217;s important to know that having a break will do both the service user and the carer good in the long term. It may ultimately mean that the carer can carry on caring for longer.</p>

<li><strong>Dizziness.</strong> Feeling dizzy and difficultly with coordination and balance may be experienced.</li>
<li><strong>Head pain.</strong>  A severe headache may suddenly come and possible vomiting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the…</p>
<p><strong>FAST:</strong> <strong>F</strong>ace-<strong>A</strong>rms-<strong>S</strong>peech-<strong>T</strong>ime.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-226 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="1001" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg 1500w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-585x390.jpeg 585w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-768x513.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-1200x801.jpeg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>There are many options available for obtaining care, and we respect your right to choose the services that meet your unique home care needs. If you are being discharged from a hospital, the Discharge Planner should work with you and your family to understand your individual home care needs based on your condition and expected recovery.</p>
<p>If home care is recommended, and you are insured through Medicare, the hospital is required to give you a list of all the home care agencies that can serve you at home, in addition to any hospital sponsored or owned home care services. It is your choice to decide who comes in your home and cares for you.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 prohibits discrimination of post-hospital referrals to home health agencies and other entities.</p>
<p>SEC 4321 entitled &#8220;NONDISCRIMINATION IN POST-HOSPITAL REFERRAL TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES&#8221; pertains to notification of availability of home health agencies and other entities as part of the discharge planning process.  This section is amended to add &#8220;Consistent with section 1802, the discharge plan shall not specify or otherwise limit the qualified provider which may provide post-hospital home health services and identify any entity to whom the individual is referred in which the hospital has a disclosable financial interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the discharge planning process, hospitals are required to include &#8220;the availability of home health services through individuals and entities that participate in the Medicare Program and that serve the area in which the patient resides and that request to be listed by the hospital as available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, it is your right to choose your home health care provider.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="margin-top: -30px;">Home care: Combining Affordability and Convenience</h5>
<p>When it comes to health care, cost is an important consideration to take. No one wants to sacrifice quality to save a few bucks, and luckily there are options to suit every senior&#8217;s unique needs and limitations.  The infographic above outlines some of the key factors that point to at-home care as a reliable, convenient and affordable option. Here are also a few things to remember when making the home care decision for yourself or a loved one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-220" src="/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg" alt="img" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg 1500w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-585x390.jpeg 585w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<h5>Inpatient Facilities vs. Home Options</h5>
<p>According to statistics from John Hancock, a nursing home with a private room can cost more than $94,000 per year, a rate that&#8217;s rising by about 3.6 percent each year. A semi-private room offers some of savings, but at $82,855 annually may still be expensive for some families. Assisted living facilities, which provide seniors with care tailored to their needs, can cost more than $41,000 each year, with prices rising by 2 percent yearly.</p>
<p>Elderly individuals who need daily help getting dressed, bathing, cooking and carrying out other day-to-day activities but don&#8217;t necessarily need regular medical care may be best suited for a home health aide. In 2013, a professional caregiver cost American families on average about $29,600 each year &#8211; or roughly $19 per hour. Additionally, the cost of an aide is only rising by 1.3 percent yearly, meaning that families can budget ahead securely. Further, statistics show that an at-home caregiver may actually save patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder up to $300 per month as a result of reduced trips to the emergency room and fewer hospitalizations.</p>
<h5>Maintaining a Quality Life</h5>
<p>For many older people, keeping a good quality of life trumps cost. The American Association of Retired Persons reports that home care is the choice of 82 percent of seniors because it doesn&#8217;t disrupt the life they&#8217;ve built for themselves. This kind of care allows seniors to maintain their relationships and homes while still getting the attention and help they need. Additionally, when seniors are being taken care of as soon as the need arises, they tend to have better health outcomes down the road, according to the AARP.</p>
