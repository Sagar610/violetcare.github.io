<h4>What are the symptoms?</h4>
<p>The word dementia describes a group of symptoms that may include memory loss, difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language, and sometimes changes in mood or behaviour. These changes are often small to start with, but for someone with dementia they have become bad enough to affect daily life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dementia isn&#8217;t a natural part of ageing. It occurs when the brain is affected by a disease.</p>
<p>There are many known causes of dementia &#8211; probably more than 100. The most common types are <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2227&amp;pageNumber=5">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a> and <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2227&amp;pageNumber=5">vascular</a>. Some people have a combination of these, known as <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=2227&amp;pageNumber=5">mixed dementia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is predicted there will be around 850,000 people in the UK with the disease in 2018.</li>
<li>The chance of developing  the disease increases significantly with age. One in 14 people over 65 years of age, and one in six people over 80, have it. It is more common among women than men.</li>
<li>More than 40,000 <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents.php?categoryID=200350">younger people</a> (under the age of 65) in the UK have the disease. This is called early-onset or young-onset dementia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dementia is an umbrella term. It describes the symptoms that occur when the brain is affected by certain diseases or conditions. There are many different types, although some are far more common than others. They are often named according to the condition that has caused the disease. Some of the more common types are outlined below.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the most common cause. During the course of the disease, the chemistry and structure of the brain changes, leading to the death of brain cells.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=100">What is Alzheimer&#8217;s disease?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Vascular dementia</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the oxygen supply to the brain fails, brain cells may die. The symptoms of vascular dementia can occur either suddenly, following a stroke, or over time, through a series of small strokes.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=161">What is vascular dementia?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dementia with Lewy bodies</h3>
<ul>
<li>This form of the disease gets its name from tiny spherical structures that develop inside nerve cells. Their presence in the brain leads to the degeneration of brain tissue.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=113">What is dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Fronto-temporal dementia</h3>
<ul>
<li>In fronto-temporal dementia, damage is usually focused in the front part of the brain. Personality and behaviour are initially more affected than memory.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=167">What is fronto-temporal dementia (including Pick&#8217;s disease)?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Rarer causes of dementia</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are many other rarer causes, including progressive supranuclear palsy and Binswanger&#8217;s disease. People with multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and Huntington&#8217;s disease can also be at an increased risk of developing the disease.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=135">Rarer causes of dementia</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prions are infectious agents that attack the central nervous system and then invade the brain, causing dementia. The best-known prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=135">Rarer causes of dementia</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Korsakoff&#8217;s syndrome</h3>
<ul>
<li>Korsakoff&#8217;s syndrome is a brain disorder that is usually associated with heavy drinking over a long period. Although it is not strictly speaking a type of the disease, people with the condition experience loss of short term memory.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=98">What is Korsakoff&#8217;s syndrome?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>HIV-related cognitive impairment</h3>
<ul>
<li>People with HIV and AIDS sometimes develop cognitive impairment, particularly in the later stages of their illness.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=97">What is HIV-related cognitive impairment?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Mild cognitive impairment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a relatively recent term, used to describe people who have some problems with their memory but do not actually have  the disease.</li>
<li>Factsheet: <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=120">Mild cognitive impairment</a></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can hire a live in carer who will offer you all that you’ll get from an agency worker, but you’ll also get the continuity, familiarity and ongoing relationship with your assistant.</p>
<p>However, if you employ a personal assistant, you will then have the legal responsibility of an employer. This will include arranging cover for their illness and holidays.</p>
<p>If you employ a live in carer privately, you will not be obliged to use the DBS scheme, but you can use it if you choose to. You need to ask social services or the police to make the checks on your behalf. The care worker must have already applied to be vetted, and must consent to the check.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the suitability of someone you employ privately to work with a vulnerable adult or child, you can ask social services to investigate the matter. They can refer the worker to the ISA on your behalf.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employing-staff">GOV.UK has more information on becoming an employer</a>, whilst <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/elderly-care">Which? Elderly Care </a>also has advice on employing private individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>Homecare from charities</u></h4>
<p>Charities such as Age UK and Carers Trust can provide home help and live in carer services. The Carers Trust supports carers by giving them a break from their caring responsibilities through homecare services.</p>
<p>Marie Curie Nurses can provide practical and emotional support for people near the end of their lives in their own homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Violet Care’s top tips</u></strong></h4>
<p>Becoming an employer of a live in carer can be a successful arrangement, but as an employer there are certain legal obligations that must be complied with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance, both Employers Liability Insurance and Public Liability Insurance, will need to be taken out.</li>
<li>You must have a written job description and a contract of employment for your live in carer.</li>
<li>References should always be obtained and checked upon receipt.</li>
<li>Have a back-up plan for your live-in worker who is familiar with your care needs in case of absence for sickness.</li>
<li>It is likely that you will need to deduct tax and National Insurance contributions and forward them to HM Revenue and Customs.</li>
<li>You must pay the Minimum Wage Rate and be aware of the maximum number of hours per week that your worker may work. Rest breaks must be given and hours of work agreed.</li>
<li>Holiday pay is a legal obligation and it is likely that you will be responsible for sick pay. Employers must also contribute to pensions by 2016.</li>
<li>Information about disciplinary and grievance procedures must be given.</li>
<li>Training should be given in your own needs as well as Health and safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The alternative to employing your own live in carer</strong></h3>
<p>At Violet Care Agency LTD, we can help you to find the right live in carer to suit you and your care needs. We have a team of carers managed by a highly experienced live in carer manager.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where an individual requires care, and is able to give their consent, it may be advisable for a member, or members of their family to be granted a power of attorney. This gives them the power to act legally on their relative’s behalf for financial and property matters, plus decisions on welfare and medical treatment. Although not mandatory, it is advisable to establish a lasting power of attorney through a solicitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>What is a power of attorney?</u></h3>
<p>A power of attorney enables someone else to manage your affairs on your behalf when you are no longer able to or no longer want to.</p>
<h4>The variety of Power of Attorney include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Property and Financial Affairs Power of Attorney</li>
<li>Heath &amp; Welfare Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)</li>
<li>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)</li>
<li>Ordinary Power of Attorney (OPA)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An LPA is a legal document which allows you to choose someone to make decisions for you when you no longer want to or are no longer able to. LPA replaced the previous system of Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) in 2007, and gives your representative the right to manage your affairs and make decisions on your behalf. There are two types of LPA – one for Property and Financial Affairs and for Health and Welfare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Property and Financial Affairs Power of Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>A Property and Financial Affairs LPA enables you to give an attorney the power to make any decisions as if they were you (acting in your best interests of course).</p>
<p>The LPA needs to be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) in England and Wales before the person can act on your behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Health and Welfare Lasting Power or Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>A Health and Welfare LPA enables someone of your choice to make decision about some or all of your health and welfare matters. Your appointed attorney(s) will only be able to make decisions after the LPA is registered with the OPG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Enduring Power of Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>Although LPA replaced Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) in 2007, EPAs that were made before 1 October 2007 can still be used. EPAs must be registered with the OPG (Office of the Public Guardian) if the donor is losing mental capacity. EPA only covers property and finances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><em><u>Ordinary Power of Attorney</u></em></h5>
<p>Another type of PoA is known as Ordinary Power of Attorney which only covers property and finances and ceases if the donor loses mental capacity. Ordinary PoA never needs to be registered with any authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>When to set up an Lasting Power of Attorney</u></h4>
<p>Anyone aged 18 or over can make an LPA appointing one or more attorneys to act on their behalf. It is important to make the LPA while you are still capable of making decisions about who to appoint as your attorneys and what powers you want to give them. The LPA cannot be used until it is registered with the OPG, which you can do at any point after it has been made. Even after it has been registered, your attorneys will have to act within any restrictions or conditions you have set out in the LPA form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>For more information on this subject, we recommend reading the Citizen&#8217;s Advice guide to POA, which can be found <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/family/looking-after-people/managing-affairs-for-someone-else/">here</a>.</h4>

<p>As a live-in carer, travelling around the UK is part of the job. You could load up your phone with 10 different apps but that makes planning a journey frustrating and time-consuming. Journey Pro is a great app (free version available with ads: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/journey-pro-london-uk-by-navitime/id388628933">iOs</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navitime.journeypro&amp;hl=en_GB">Android</a>) which has everything you need to plan a journey anywhere in the country. Particularly good for navigating the London Underground, it provides up-to-the-minute journey options. It also provides maps and journey planning across the entire national rail system, as well as allowing searches by bus route, or giving you the quickest option postcode-to-postcode. It’s the kind of app, that, once you have it, you’ll wonder what you did without it.</td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has become frequently common for our landlines and mobiles to be bombarded with cold calls and texts. They range from surveys and insurance to the selling of products or services. Not only is it inconvenient and annoying but regular calls can become intimidating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Avoiding Scams &#8211; There are many ways that you can protect yourself from cold calls.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You can contact your phone provider and they should be able to inform you of what privacy and even call blocking services they have available. Be aware though that these services are not always free of charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You can register with the Telephone Preference Service. This is a free service and they allow you to opt out of unsolicited live telesales calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Never give any financial information out on the telephone. Your bank or building society would never ask for you to provide these details.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your local mobile phone shop would also be able to provide you with some information on the type of mobile phone you have and what type of call blocking is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many different ways that you or a loved one can be conned out of money. Two examples of recent scams are a caller advising that your current bank account is not safe and has been compromised. They then offer to transfer the money to a protected bank account. The caller will sound official but urgent to make you feel like your current bank account is being targeted right at that moment. BEWARE even when you hang up and call your bank to check if the call was legitimate these people may still be on the line. If at all possible take down all of the details and pass them to a relative to call and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second scam involves a person acting like a courier. They will claim your bank cards have fraudulently been used and will be taken with your pin to the police. Once again they will catch you unawares and pressure you with urgency. People will even knock on your door and try to convince you that there is a problem with your roof or sell you a service that is expensive and you do not require. It can be a good idea to have a <strong>No Cold Caller</strong> sign located near the front door. You could fit a spy hole and always ask who is calling, request ID and if you haven&#8217;t booked a pre arranged repair do not open the door. Most gas or electric suppliers will even give their elderly customers a password that only their engineer will have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some free &#8216;no cold caller&#8217; signs for you to print off and affix to your doors/windows:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="margin-top: -30px;">You Have the Right to Choose Your Home Health Care Service Provider</h5>
<p>Federal hospital law guarantees a person&#8217;s right to choose the home care provider that he or she wants in their home following discharge from a hospital. This is an important health care right and we understand how difficult this decision can be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-226 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="1001" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg 1500w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-585x390.jpeg 585w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-768x513.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-1200x801.jpeg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>There are many options available for obtaining care, and we respect your right to choose the services that meet your unique home care needs. If you are being discharged from a hospital, the Discharge Planner should work with you and your family to understand your individual home care needs based on your condition and expected recovery.</p>
<p>If home care is recommended, and you are insured through Medicare, the hospital is required to give you a list of all the home care agencies that can serve you at home, in addition to any hospital sponsored or owned home care services. It is your choice to decide who comes in your home and cares for you.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 prohibits discrimination of post-hospital referrals to home health agencies and other entities.</p>
<p>SEC 4321 entitled &#8220;NONDISCRIMINATION IN POST-HOSPITAL REFERRAL TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES&#8221; pertains to notification of availability of home health agencies and other entities as part of the discharge planning process.  This section is amended to add &#8220;Consistent with section 1802, the discharge plan shall not specify or otherwise limit the qualified provider which may provide post-hospital home health services and identify any entity to whom the individual is referred in which the hospital has a disclosable financial interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the discharge planning process, hospitals are required to include &#8220;the availability of home health services through individuals and entities that participate in the Medicare Program and that serve the area in which the patient resides and that request to be listed by the hospital as available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, it is your right to choose your home health care provider.</p>

<h5>Support with daily activities</h5>
<p>If an older loved one becomes frail or weakened by the progression of an illness or age-related condition, it’s a good time to get extra help at home. This allows your parent or grandparent to continue to live independently in the home they love, getting the support they need to stay safe and happy. This type of care is all about maintaining a good quality of life with maximum independence.</p>
<h5>After the death of a spouse</h5>
<p>Home care can also be very helpful when a spouse passes. The older loved one now living alone may want companionship or need help with meals, household chores, or driving, as well as support staying active and connected with friends and the community.</p>
<h5>When a caregiver needs a break</h5>
<p>Something as simple as a family vacation, a change in a family caregiver’s work schedule, a sick child, or caregiver fatigue can also trigger a need for home care. When a family caregiver can’t be there or needs a break to rest and recharge, this type of care is called respite care. Whether it’s for a few hours, a few days, or more, respite care is highly recommended for family caregivers, especially when caring for a loved one with a chronic condition or progressive disease such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, or other dementia.</p>
<h5>After a serious medical episode</h5>
<p>Home care can also be very helpful after a serious medical episode, such as a stroke, heart attack, major surgery, or bad fall. Your physician may recommend professional care to support optimum recovery and rehabilitation at home following discharge. In many cases, setting up professional home care is a requirement for discharge from a hospital or medical facility.</p>
<h5>For a chronic condition or illness</h5>
<p>In addition to supporting daily activities and providing companionship, home care is also helpful when caring for a loved one with a chronic condition or serious illness at home. This type of specialized care can offer families many benefits: respite care or additional support for family caregivers, assistance when a loved one needs care overnight, help with transferring, lifting, and toileting, as well as managing illness symptoms and treatment side-effects. Setting up quality, personalized home care for someone with a chronic condition or illness can enable that person to continue to live at home with greater safety and comfort.</p>
<h5>When time is limited</h5>
<p>Near the end of life, home care provides families and their loved ones emotional support and compassionate assistance to improve physical comfort during this difficult time. A care professional can help support hospice workers, provide assistance with personal care when hospice workers aren’t present, or simply be there—24/7 if necessary—so no one ever has to be alone in their final hours. An experienced care professional also knows the best practices and procedures for assisting a person at the end of their life with compassion and sensitivity.</p>
