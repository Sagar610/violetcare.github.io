We hope these packs will be useful for our service users to stay connected to the world around them.  <br><br> These packs contain natural materials such as shells and pebbles as well as images themed around nature. Each activity encourages the participant to tune in to the way they are feeling which can reduce anxiety and stress. <br><br> We would like to thank the local Hobbycraft and Tesco for donating art materials which have helped bring this initiative to fruition.  </figcaption></figure>

<p></p>



<p>You might be feeling worried about Coronavirus also known as COVID &#8211; 19, which is currently causing us all to think more carefully about our actions and how we look after ourselves and one another. </p>



<p>Violet
Care Agency will strive to continue to provide excellent and compassionate care
to all it’s service users. All of our carers will wear essential personal
protective equipment, which includes, aprons and gloves. </p>



<p>Staff
have been instructed by our Training and Development Manager to be extra
vigilant and continue to wash their hands using soap and water frequently and
in-between all care tasks. If you feel that other precautions are needed in
order to help you feel safer, please do contact the office so that these can be
considered. </p>



<p>At this time many might feel anxious about the virus whilst being at home self-isolating or in quarantine.</p>



<p>There are lot’s of ways that you can take care of ourselves, which includes making sure that your wellbeing is looked after. </p>



<p>Here
are some suggestions: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Eat well, and stay hydrated</strong>: Ensure that you have access to healthy foods, including fruits and vegetables. Drink regularly and often, it might be helpful to vary the flavours of drinks by having fruit squash’s or herbal teas. </li><li><strong>Plan and structure your day:</strong> Healthy minds need to be stimulated regularly. You might introduce meaningful activities that you enjoy, like completing crosswords, combing through old and new magazines, folding your laundry and taking time to observe how you’re feeling.   </li><li><strong>Stay Connected:</strong> Our development and growth is based on our capacity to interact and be received by others. Without this, we begin to lose our sense of who we are which can feel frightening and confusing. Arrange a time to speak to a loved one on the phone. Write a letter to a friend or neighbour. Write down something you might like talk about or say to your carer. Send an email or ask for support around how to do this. </li><li><strong>Surround Yourself in Nature:</strong> Where this is possible try to get outside in your garden to feel the sun on your shoulders. Open your curtains and your windows. Look up at the sky. Take care of a plant or a cactus. </li><li><strong>Stay Active:</strong> We need to keep our bodies moving and stimulated. This might include a gentle slow walk to the window. You might prefer to carefully do gentle exercises from the comfort of a chair. It might feel helpful to play some music to sway to. There are many exercise ideas which can be found online, Youtube especially is a good place to search for instruction videos . </li><li><strong>Relax:</strong> Schedule some time in your day to relax, this might include art making, smelling incense, listening to classical music or creative writing. </li></ul>



<p>Violet Care Agency has dedicated Reassurance Support Officers who are contactable on: 01279 434444. </p>



<p>Please get in touch and our officers will be able to listen and
reassure you. </p>



<p>If you are a service user, please ask to speak with Eve. </p>



<p>If you are a staff member, please ask to speak with Laura. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">We are all different, facing different challenges day by day, living different lives. This can be overwhelming sometimes and we can struggle to be with our emotions when things aren’t going the way we imagined or planned…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The staff at Violet Care were asked what they do to look after their mental health&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I channel my negative energies into sport and exercise ”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I go for long walks and I talk about my feelings when I feel ready.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Spending time with my children helps me to feel better.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I get creative and use art making to help express my thoughts and feelings”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We asked the same question, but thinking about how we can support other people’s mental health needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I can help others by, keeping an eye out and being ready to listen.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I can check in with someone who I haven’t seen or heard from in a while”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I can always find time to reach out to someone and maybe invite them round for dinner.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It’s so important to keep the conversation about mental health <strong>open</strong> so that we can keep ourselves and others healthy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What things do you for you and for others when it comes to thinking about mental health?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Violet Care we think that by making modern technology more accessible to elderly people, we can significantly improve their quality of life. The Future Foundation&#8217;s Report, &#8216;Care Beyond 2020&#8217;, identifies the important role that technology can play in the future provision of Social Care. We agree. That’s why, unlike many traditional Adult Care organisations we see a need to have a physical presence augmented by technology.</p>
<p>We can set up systems which help to keep our elderly service users connected to their families, no matter how far away they may be. The technology behind our Violet Care Connect gives family members the opportunity to check that agreed visits have taken place. We can even, subject to all the appropriate agreements, help you to monitor what is happening in an older relative&#8217;s home and send you alerts if we think help is needed.</p>
<p>However, our main focus is primarily aimed at helping elderly people gain as much as possible from the available technology. We can help anyone, from complete computer novices, to people who have some experience but would like to know more.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Ways in which we can help the elderly include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using technology to keep in touch with relatives. For example, seeing grandchildren via free video calls, using email to communicate with other family members, and learning how to use the internet safely</li>
<li>Setting up and making the most of broadband, including advice on the most cost effective options</li>
<li>Installing antivirus and security software</li>
<li>Making full use of mobile phones, smart phones and tablet computers</li>
<li>As well as accessing catch up TV services</li>
<li>Learning how to use the latest television re-coding systems with simplicity of use a priority</li>
<li>&#8216;How to&#8217; seminars to help customers get the most from the technology they already own</li>
<li>Impartial advice on buying new technology equipment or upgrading existing equipment</li>
<li>Also, a telephone helpline to help resolve technology problems</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also have sensors around your home fitted&#8230;</p>
<h5>Sensors include:</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community Alarm</strong>
<ul>
<li>A personal alarm that allows you to call for help when you need it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bed Occupancy</strong>
<ul>
<li>Monitors if you leave the bed but don&#8217;t return after a period of time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Button Telephone</strong>
<ul>
<li>Large black buttons and white numbers for the visually impaired and a call indicator and volume control for hearing difficulties<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1005" src="/wp-content/uploads/81XERtqwy9L._SL1500_-585x339.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/81XERtqwy9L._SL1500_-585x339.jpg 585w, /wp-content/uploads/81XERtqwy9L._SL1500_-768x445.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/81XERtqwy9L._SL1500_-1200x696.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/81XERtqwy9L._SL1500_-100x58.jpg 100w, /wp-content/uploads/81XERtqwy9L._SL1500_.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of people with dementia will benefit from receiving social care. This is because condition can make it significantly more difficult for them to carry out everyday tasks as usual. Social care is different to care provided on the NHS such as A&amp;E hospital appointments or routine Doctors’ appointments.</p>
<p>Social care is means tested. This means that people who have assets of over £23,250 will have to pay for their own care as it is not free on the NHS. We estimate that the typical care costs for this illness would take around 125 years to gather the funds for. This is where dementia differentiates from other long-term health conditions such as heart problems and cancer. &#8211; These two illnesses are treatable free of charge on the NHS whereas patients will not receive free dementia care. It doesn’t seem like a fair system for some people to receive free treatment for their conditions and others to have to pay for it. Many organisations such as The Alzheimer’s Society has been trying to end ‘the dementia tax’ for years.</p>
<p>We at Violet Care believe that patients suffering from this illness should not have to suffer the costs of their care single handedly. – Even if people save up money early for their retirement, it would still take the average person over a lifetime to save for their dementia care. Please ask us about funding options. You may be able to receive your care fully funded. We are also able to take direct payments from your Council.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of our customers tell us that they want to know how to integrate their carer affecting a positive working relationship.</p>
<h4>Here are our 7 top tips on how to integrate your carer into your home:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be clear. </strong>Remember that your carer is there to help you. &#8211; Carers are appreciative to hear if there is something specific that you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Recruit carefully</strong> and make sure that you use a CQC registered Care Agency. CQC approved organisations are bound to follow strict recruitment and training processes. Using a CQC registered agency ensures you are receiving the best possible care from trained carers. Therefore, the integration process will be much easier.<a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/provider/1-3508365576">Here you can see that The Violet Care Agency is fully CQC compliant.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>All parties should read the care plan carefully. <strong>The Care plan is what will make up the basis of your agreement with your carer. </strong> Due to this, checking the care plan to ensure it is thorough and complete is important.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Service users and/or family/friends should communicate with the care managers during spot checks.<strong> Spot checks</strong> are normally set up so that the carers’ quality of work can be inspected. This ensures you are receiving the highest quality of care at all times. Spot checks can be ideal opportunities for you to share any changes that you’d like to make.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make sure that the care agency offers ongoing <strong>care worker training. </strong>As a result, your carer&#8217;s skills and knowledge will be kept up to date. The best way of ensuring that you are receiving the best care is with ongoing training. You can find out about The Violet Care Agency&#8217;s training <a href="/caregivers/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Finally, if your carer does something that you are unhappy about, it is not necessary to wait for a scheduled meeting. Contact your care provider so they can <strong>address the problem immediately</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
