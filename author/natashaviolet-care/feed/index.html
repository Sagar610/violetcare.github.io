										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Violet Care we think that by making modern technology more accessible to elderly people, we can significantly improve their quality of life. The Future Foundation&#8217;s Report, &#8216;Care Beyond 2020&#8217;, identifies the important role that technology can play in the future provision of Social Care. We agree. That’s why, unlike many traditional Adult Care organisations we see a need to have a physical presence augmented by technology.</p>
<p>We can set up systems which help to keep our elderly service users connected to their families, no matter how far away they may be. The technology behind our Violet Care Connect gives family members the opportunity to check that agreed visits have taken place. We can even, subject to all the appropriate agreements, help you to monitor what is happening in an older relative&#8217;s home and send you alerts if we think help is needed.</p>
<p>However, our main focus is primarily aimed at helping elderly people gain as much as possible from the available technology. We can help anyone, from complete computer novices, to people who have some experience but would like to know more.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Ways in which we can help the elderly include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using technology to keep in touch with relatives. For example, seeing grandchildren via free video calls, using email to communicate with other family members, and learning how to use the internet safely</li>
<li>Setting up and making the most of broadband, including advice on the most cost effective options</li>
<li>Installing antivirus and security software</li>
<li>Making full use of mobile phones, smart phones and tablet computers</li>
<li>As well as accessing catch up TV services</li>
<li>Learning how to use the latest television re-coding systems with simplicity of use a priority</li>
<li>&#8216;How to&#8217; seminars to help customers get the most from the technology they already own</li>
<li>Impartial advice on buying new technology equipment or upgrading existing equipment</li>
<li>Also, a telephone helpline to help resolve technology problems</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also have sensors around your home fitted&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of people with dementia will benefit from receiving social care. This is because condition can make it significantly more difficult for them to carry out everyday tasks as usual. Social care is different to care provided on the NHS such as A&amp;E hospital appointments or routine Doctors’ appointments.</p>
<p>Social care is means tested. This means that people who have assets of over £23,250 will have to pay for their own care as it is not free on the NHS. We estimate that the typical care costs for this illness would take around 125 years to gather the funds for. This is where dementia differentiates from other long-term health conditions such as heart problems and cancer. &#8211; These two illnesses are treatable free of charge on the NHS whereas patients will not receive free dementia care. It doesn’t seem like a fair system for some people to receive free treatment for their conditions and others to have to pay for it. Many organisations such as The Alzheimer’s Society has been trying to end ‘the dementia tax’ for years.</p>
<p>We at Violet Care believe that patients suffering from this illness should not have to suffer the costs of their care single handedly. – Even if people save up money early for their retirement, it would still take the average person over a lifetime to save for their dementia care. Please ask us about funding options. You may be able to receive your care fully funded. We are also able to take direct payments from your Council.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of our customers tell us that they want to know how to integrate their carer affecting a positive working relationship.</p>
<h4>Here are our 7 top tips on how to integrate your carer into your home:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be clear. </strong>Remember that your carer is there to help you. &#8211; Carers are appreciative to hear if there is something specific that you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Recruit carefully</strong> and make sure that you use a CQC registered Care Agency. CQC approved organisations are bound to follow strict recruitment and training processes. Using a CQC registered agency ensures you are receiving the best possible care from trained carers. Therefore, the integration process will be much easier.<a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/provider/1-3508365576">Here you can see that The Violet Care Agency is fully CQC compliant.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>All parties should read the care plan carefully. <strong>The Care plan is what will make up the basis of your agreement with your carer. </strong> Due to this, checking the care plan to ensure it is thorough and complete is important.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Service users and/or family/friends should communicate with the care managers during spot checks.<strong> Spot checks</strong> are normally set up so that the carers’ quality of work can be inspected. This ensures you are receiving the highest quality of care at all times. Spot checks can be ideal opportunities for you to share any changes that you’d like to make.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make sure that the care agency offers ongoing <strong>care worker training. </strong>As a result, your carer&#8217;s skills and knowledge will be kept up to date. The best way of ensuring that you are receiving the best care is with ongoing training. You can find out about The Violet Care Agency&#8217;s training <a href="/caregivers/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Finally, if your carer does something that you are unhappy about, it is not necessary to wait for a scheduled meeting. Contact your care provider so they can <strong>address the problem immediately</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
