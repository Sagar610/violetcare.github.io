We hope these packs will be useful for our service users to stay connected to the world around them.  <br><br> These packs contain natural materials such as shells and pebbles as well as images themed around nature. Each activity encourages the participant to tune in to the way they are feeling which can reduce anxiety and stress. <br><br> We would like to thank the local Hobbycraft and Tesco for donating art materials which have helped bring this initiative to fruition.  </figcaption></figure>

<p>You might be feeling worried about Coronavirus also known as COVID &#8211; 19, which is currently causing us all to think more carefully about our actions and how we look after ourselves and one another. </p>



<p>Violet
Care Agency will strive to continue to provide excellent and compassionate care
to all it’s service users. All of our carers will wear essential personal
protective equipment, which includes, aprons and gloves. </p>



<p>Staff
have been instructed by our Training and Development Manager to be extra
vigilant and continue to wash their hands using soap and water frequently and
in-between all care tasks. If you feel that other precautions are needed in
order to help you feel safer, please do contact the office so that these can be
considered. </p>



<p>At this time many might feel anxious about the virus whilst being at home self-isolating or in quarantine.</p>



<p>There are lot’s of ways that you can take care of ourselves, which includes making sure that your wellbeing is looked after. </p>



<p>Here
are some suggestions: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Eat well, and stay hydrated</strong>: Ensure that you have access to healthy foods, including fruits and vegetables. Drink regularly and often, it might be helpful to vary the flavours of drinks by having fruit squash’s or herbal teas. </li><li><strong>Plan and structure your day:</strong> Healthy minds need to be stimulated regularly. You might introduce meaningful activities that you enjoy, like completing crosswords, combing through old and new magazines, folding your laundry and taking time to observe how you’re feeling.   </li><li><strong>Stay Connected:</strong> Our development and growth is based on our capacity to interact and be received by others. Without this, we begin to lose our sense of who we are which can feel frightening and confusing. Arrange a time to speak to a loved one on the phone. Write a letter to a friend or neighbour. Write down something you might like talk about or say to your carer. Send an email or ask for support around how to do this. </li><li><strong>Surround Yourself in Nature:</strong> Where this is possible try to get outside in your garden to feel the sun on your shoulders. Open your curtains and your windows. Look up at the sky. Take care of a plant or a cactus. </li><li><strong>Stay Active:</strong> We need to keep our bodies moving and stimulated. This might include a gentle slow walk to the window. You might prefer to carefully do gentle exercises from the comfort of a chair. It might feel helpful to play some music to sway to. There are many exercise ideas which can be found online, Youtube especially is a good place to search for instruction videos . </li><li><strong>Relax:</strong> Schedule some time in your day to relax, this might include art making, smelling incense, listening to classical music or creative writing. </li></ul>



<p>Violet Care Agency has dedicated Reassurance Support Officers who are contactable on: 01279 434444. </p>



<p>Please get in touch and our officers will be able to listen and
reassure you. </p>



<p>If you are a service user, please ask to speak with Eve. </p>



<p>If you are a staff member, please ask to speak with Laura. </p>

It will prompt you to agree to a disclaimer. Once you accept the terms, you will be able to set up SOS Messages.<br><br>Click “Send messages to” to select up to four emergency contacts to receive your emergency alerts. <br><br><strong>Apps</strong><br>Suggested apps that both contact and can record various details of your emergency quickly are: <br>&#8211; Shake2Alert<br>-SOS Emergency App<br>-Emergency button [SOS] <br>-Shake2Safety<br><br><strong>Texts: </strong><br>You can text 999 to request services. <br>In order to do this, first you must register by texting 999. <br> You will get a reply and will then need to follow the instructions you are sent. <br>The text system is meant to be used only when voice calls cannot be made and the system does not guarantee that texts will be delivered so users should wait until they receive a reply from the emergency services before assuming help has been summoned. <br><br></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">In this life we share many similarities and common experiences which unite us all. Sometimes expectations and the speed with which we are living warps the way that we relate to one another.  When we recognise that our experience of what might feel like unique suffering is likely to be identified with and shared with others &#8211; we open the door to compassion and empathy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">The Caring Care Professional:</span></strong><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif">A care professional is generally expected to carry out many different duties that support the individual to live their life as independently as possible. This part of the job is important, however, in equal measure, their <span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">behaviour, manner and communication of body language are key components which help to make meaningful relationships. Empathy and compassion are inherent in the role of a care professional, and when these are demonstrated, it helps for clients to <strong>feel seen, heard, understood and cared</strong> for.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">The service user&#8217;s supporting circle of family and friends need empathy and compassion too, as often the suffering of the individual needing care is connected with the people who care about them. Strong and nurturing relationships promote the feeling of<strong><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif"> stability</span></strong> and <strong><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif">trust,</span></strong> and without this, care professionals leave their clients and their support circles vulnerable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">We also need to look after the connections we create with other staff members. When we reach out to our colleagues in their moment of need, it helps for individuals to feel connected and valued in their work enviroment.  In addition, when colleagues demonstrate active listening and express empathy and compassion, service user’s and their supporting circle gain an insight into the authenticity of their carers by the way that they treat others.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>World Mental Health Day. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We are all different, facing different challenges day by day, living different lives. This can be overwhelming sometimes and we can struggle to be with our emotions when things aren’t going the way we imagined or planned…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The staff at Violet Care were asked what they do to look after their mental health&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I channel my negative energies into sport and exercise ”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I go for long walks and I talk about my feelings when I feel ready.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Spending time with my children helps me to feel better.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I get creative and use art making to help express my thoughts and feelings”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We asked the same question, but thinking about how we can support other people’s mental health needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I can help others by, keeping an eye out and being ready to listen.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I can check in with someone who I haven’t seen or heard from in a while”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I can always find time to reach out to someone and maybe invite them round for dinner.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It’s so important to keep the conversation about mental health <strong>open</strong> so that we can keep ourselves and others healthy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What things do you for you and for others when it comes to thinking about mental health?</strong></p>
