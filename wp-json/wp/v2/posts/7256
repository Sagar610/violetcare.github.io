We hope these packs will be useful for our service users to stay connected to the world around them.  <br><br> These packs contain natural materials such as shells and pebbles as well as images themed around nature. Each activity encourages the participant to tune in to the way they are feeling which can reduce anxiety and stress. <br><br> We would like to thank the local Hobbycraft and Tesco for donating art materials which have helped bring this initiative to fruition.  <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"643\" height=\"123\" src=\"https:\/\/www.violet.care\/wp-content\/uploads\/sponsers.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7260\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/sponsers.png 643w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/sponsers-585x112.png 585w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/sponsers-100x19.png 100w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/sponsers-600x115.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" \/><figcaption>These packs will be distributed by our carers from the 30.3.20. <br>It would be lovely for service users to share images of what they&#8217;ve created using the packs so that we can share these on the website so that others can take inspiration. <br><br>You can send your images to <strong>therapy@violet.care<\/strong><br><br><br> <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Combating isolation, and promoting connectedness through the use of art making during COVID-19.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":7258,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[19,1],"tags":[1330,1325,1328,1332],"yst_prominent_words":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/WELLNESS-PACKS.jpg","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7256"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7256"}],"version-history":[{"count":13,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7256\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7301,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7256\/revisions\/7301"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7258"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7256"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7256"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7256"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=7256"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
