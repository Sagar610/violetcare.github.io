The Future Foundation&#8217;s Report, &#8216;Care Beyond 2020&#8217;, identifies the important role that technology can play in the future provision of Social Care. We agree. That\u2019s why, unlike many traditional Adult Care organisations we see a need to have\u00a0a physical presence augmented by technology.<\/p>\n<p>We can set up systems which help\u00a0to keep our elderly service users connected to their families, no matter how far away they may\u00a0be. The technology behind our Violet Care Connect gives family members the opportunity to check that agreed visits have taken place. We can even, subject to all the appropriate agreements, help you to\u00a0monitor what is happening in an older relative&#8217;s\u00a0home and send you alerts if we think help is needed.<\/p>\n<p>However, our main focus is primarily aimed at helping elderly people gain as much as possible from the\u00a0available technology. We can help anyone, from complete computer novices, to people who have some experience but would like to know more.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Ways in which we can help the elderly include:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Using technology to keep in touch with relatives. For example, seeing grandchildren via free video calls,\u00a0using email to communicate with other family members,\u00a0and learning how to use the internet\u00a0safely<\/li>\n<li>Setting up and making the most of broadband, including advice on the most cost effective options<\/li>\n<li>Installing antivirus and security software<\/li>\n<li>Making full use of mobile phones, smart phones and tablet computers<\/li>\n<li>As well as accessing catch up TV services<\/li>\n<li>Learning how to use the latest television re-coding systems with simplicity of use a priority<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;How to&#8217; seminars to help customers get the most from the technology they already own<\/li>\n<li>Impartial advice on buying new technology equipment or upgrading existing equipment<\/li>\n<li>Also, a telephone helpline to help resolve technology problems<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can also have sensors around your home fitted&#8230;<\/p>\n<h5>Sensors
